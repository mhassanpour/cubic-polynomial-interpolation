# Cubic polynomial interpolation


Suppose we want to interpolate between (n) control point with known slope and known time.
in this case we have (n-1) curves in which, each pair of control points represents
one segment of the curve and each curve segment is a cubic polynomial with its
own coefficients.

This code calculate coefficients of each curves and interpolate according to time.


For example you can use main
